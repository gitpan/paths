This is a simple program that allows you to wite a perl program
that will create a *.csh and *.sh files that set environmental
variables.  This way users can use both csh and sh compatable
shells on the same system and the admin only need maintain one
file.

This is like, version 0, I don't even check my opens yet.

Files:
	path.pm			used by paths.pm
	paths.pm		user interface (no docs yet)
	fixpath			simple example
	gen_opt_paths		more complicated example currently in
					pratical use.
